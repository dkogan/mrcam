Simple and generic camera interface for genicam cameras

The actual hardware interface used here is provided by the wonderful aravis
project:

  https://github.com/AravisProject/aravis

Any genicam camera should be supported, in theory. Without using the vendor's
unwaveringly-terrible and disparate tooling.

THIS project provides trivial interface appropriate for my use cases. And it
provides a Python API. And a visualization tool. And some extra utilities, such
as focusing and camera-sync-validation tools
