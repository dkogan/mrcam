mrcam-test is a command-line image-capture tool. It is used mostly as a
demo/test of the mrcam C API. The options are very similar to those taken by the
"mrcam" Python tool, and work the same way.

The output is the captured images on disk, written to --logdir (or if --logdir
is omitted, the images are captured, but not actually stored on disk). And each
frame metadata is written on stdout as a vnlog stream.

The frames are captured at the requested --period, in seconds. If the requested
period is <= 0, we capture the frames as quickly as possible.
