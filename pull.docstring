Reads an image from a camera. Synchronously.

SYNOPSIS

    camera = mrcam.camera()

    frame = camera.pull()

    # frame['image'] is a numpy array containing the image

pull() retrieves an image off the camera in a blocking fashion: the call will
block until the image is retrieved, or the timeout expires. To get images
asynchronously, look at request().

At this time a missed timeout is treated like any other error: we raise an
exception

ARGUMENTS

- timeout: optional floating point value indicating when we should give up
  waiting for the frame. Given in seconds. If omitted or <=0, we wait forever

RETURNED VALUE

The returned data is given in a dict with keys

- 'image':     the numpy array containing the image
- 'timestamp': the unix timestamp of the host machine during image capture, in
  floating-point seconds
